      "response": "AI is significantly enhancing supply chain demand forecasting through several methods. It utilizes time series models, such as Prophet and NeuralProphet, to predict seasonal patterns in demand. Additionally, machine learning models are employed to integrate external signals like weather conditions, events, and social media trends into forecasting, providing a more comprehensive prediction. On average, these AI-driven approaches have led to a 30-40% reduction in forecast error.\n\nA notable example",
