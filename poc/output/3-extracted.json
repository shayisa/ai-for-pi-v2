However, it relies on simplified, order-dependent alpha blending and coarse approximations of the density integral within the rasterizer, thereby limiting its ability to render complex, overlapping semi-transparent objects. In this paper, we extend rasterization-based rendering of 3D Gaus",

Some studies estimate that up to 50% of a developer’s time is spent tracking down bugs, deciphering cryptic console messages, jumping between tools, and trying to figure out why something worked five minutes ago but doesn’t now. In my recent article, AI Fluency: Build Smarter Code , I explored how modern AI tools can elevate your coding workflow. But there’s an equally important part of",
